# Spots 

An image sharing website 

## Description
In this project we applied different techniques to create adaptive and responsive layouts for different devices. We used for the first time a grid layout to make it responsive, a media query, a figma layout to export images and properties for our project and we also used the different techniques we learned in the previous sprints.

The purpose of this website is to create an interactive social networking web application where users can add and remove photos, such as photos of other users, and make some minor adjustments to their profile. The first part of this project is to make it responsive to the different devices where it can be accessed.
